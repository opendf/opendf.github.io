####Open India
The internet age calls for governments to change the way they operate and disseminate information. From day to day working reports to the statistical data collected. It's important to make all these datasets public and readily available for both academic research and non governmental oversight organizations. The project aims to compile a set of open standards that government administrators and policy makers can adapt into their own organization in the future.  

In the recent times government agencies and leaders are making an effort to make all relevant data public and accessible to their citizens. In order to maximize the benefits of these efforts further correspondence with the data consumers and the government is necessary. This direct feedback when coupled with open standards, software and formats would not only revolutionize the way governments are run but also greatly augment their accountability and the citizen's ability to get the most out of their government.
